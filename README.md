# Sample back-end application

This is a sample back-end application made to demonstrate my abilities in the back-end of a javascript web application.
I will not be allowing anyone other than myself to update the repo as that would not be a demonstration of my own skills.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the repository

- Clone repo via GitHub
- Open up your terminal or shell and change directory to the project's folder
- Type in `node app.js` and hit `Enter` or `Return`
- Open up your web browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:6000` or `http://localhost:6000` in your search bar
- Play with the server's URI parameters to request wanted data.

### Using Docker

- Run dockerfile through Docker
- Open dockerfile ( Should begin running on its own. In the event of failure, use `Ctrl+C` to kill the process )

## Application Usage

### Accessing Server's URIs

- Server
